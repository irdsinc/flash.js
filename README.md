# flash.js

FlashJS is a lightweight web framework built on JavaScript and designed to simplify application development. It is based on a view-controller design concept, where the controller handles custom behavior, such as binding events to DOM elements, to manage changes within its associated view.

In today's fast-paced world, productivity is what measures success. Don't waste time building large-scale web applications or simple content-based websites from scratch. FlashJS allows you to write less code, while maintaining highly sophisticated logic. Give your users what they want, a simple and fast browsing experience.

FlashJS was designed with extensibility in mind. It works well with other libraries, such as KnockoutJS, which can be used for data-binding dynamic content to the view through the controller and adding a way to automatically update the view when the model changes as well as update the model when the view changes.
